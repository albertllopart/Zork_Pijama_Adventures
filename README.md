*Important:     

Notice that I don't have any buy/sell system but I have something which is quite similar.     
There's an NPC that will give you a key item if you bring him a certain item. It's not an actual trade because the player     
gets to keep both items (they are both key to the adventure), but essentially it works in the same way as a trade.     

I decided to turn my fights and some puzzles to be turn based as they made no sense at all otherwise. There's an     
NPC though that can move freely through the dungeon even if the player isn't using commands.     

MOVEMENT

Move using the 'n', 's', 'e', 'w' keys, 'north/south/east/west' or 'go + north/south/east/west' commands.   
Open doors by using the 'open door' command

INFORMATION

Check door descriptions using 'look + north/south/east/west', player description using 'look + player/me/myself' or room descriptions using 'look room' command   
You can check item descriptions by using the command 'look + <item>'   
Check your inventory at any time by using the command 'look/check + inventory or inventory/inv/i   
Check what the box contains by using 'look/check + box' command   
Check your stats with the 'stats' command and check your equipment with the 'equipment, look equipment or check equipment' command

INTERACTION

Pick or drop items by using the 'pick/drop + <item>' command. You can also store items in a Box by using the commands 'put/get + <item> + into/from + box'.   
Equip and unequip items by using the commands 'equip/unequip + <item>'
Use items by using the command 'use + item'. Notice that this command will only work in certain rooms and with certain items.
